# Accessible Government Footer

This is a restyling experiment of the GWT-Footer by [iGovPhil](https://github.com/iGovPhil/gwt-footer). Styles are loaded from `gwt-standard-footer.css`.

## Highlights

* Substitutes the coat of arms logo with a high-res version from [WikiBooks
](https://tl.m.wikibooks.org/wiki/Talaksan:Coat_of_arms_of_the_Philippines.svg) and handles the monochrome version via a filter class. This repo also has a sample without the filter
* Custom-elements for markup readability
* Supports prefers-color-scheme, i.e. dark mode.

This is in no way a substitute for the GWT-Footer script, which is loaded from [i.gov.ph](https://gwhs.i.gov.ph/gwt-footer/footer-source.html), but an option for web developers if there is a need for a cleaner, more responsive version.

## TODO

- [ ] Rewrite the coat of arms svg with a simpler markup to match the original jpeg and handle `current-color` styling.
